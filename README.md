## FAQ

### What is this repo?

`theNewbieClub-MAL/cardArchive` is archival repository for cards that have been delivered by designer themselves, or assisted by deliverer team member. Aimed for giving an inspiration for new staff or returning on designing their own cards, and also for those who are looking for a way to retrieving back their cards when link given by designer/deliverer is broken/expired.

### Well, I know exactly the purpose of this repo by looking the name, but what is cards exactly?/?

> Cards or card editions are a club thing that donâ€™t serve a real purpose, but are rather collectibles that you can for example just save, show off in a blog post on MAL such as in this example here, or display them in your MAL profile, your forum signature, etc.
> [*The Newbie Club's Official GFX Encyclopedia*](https://thenewbieclub-mal.github.io/gfxEncyclopedia/#/gfx/cards)

### When this repo is created? Why there's just a few cards archived?

This repo was created and announced on [February 17, 2022](https://github.com/theNewbieClub-MAL/cardArchive/commit/6bd360bd212f2de1178fa1802474f2bd9e26f197). Some of the links given by designers before the announcement were broken, and some of the cards were not designed/created by the designer themselves due to resignation.

### Uh, I couldn't understand how to navigate on this site. Need halp

To navigate/explore, you can choose any method below:

#### Directly using GitHub

1. Click `Go on file` on top toolbar, or click this [link](https://github.com/theNewbieClub-MAL/cardArchive/find/main)
2. Start searching!

#### Using mirror site

1. First, visit [this link](https://theNewbieClub-MAL.github.io/cardArchive/) to go to the mirror site.
2. On right top, there is a search box, type in your search query, and click `Search`.
3. Start searching!

### Wait, when I visited certain designer's folder, why I saw either .gitkeep or README.md with Attention as title?

Those files are placeholder for Git read "empty" directory. By default, empty directory is not shown on Git, so you need to add `.gitkeep` file on that folder.

However, for `README.md` file, there is an additional note why the folder is empty. Mostly it is due to the link designer/deliverer has given is expired, but it also can be due to the designer resigned from the club.
