Apology gift**      :   Not eligible
Commentary          :   
      Hey,  Natsu here.  If you  found that you
    are one of  affected  on requesting "Pride!
    Edition  by  The  Newbie  Club, I apologize 
    on myself for this problem. This problem is
    unavoidable, and totally out of intent.
      As I mentioned  before on disclaimer,  30
    from 82 requests in total  got wrong cards.
    The cards were  totally swapped each others
    on my PowerPoint file,  means "Yagate  Kimi
    ni Naru" that should  placed on third card,
    was swapped with 4th card, "Citrus." I know
    this  is human  failure  because  I did not
    check arrangements BEFORE I  started making
    cards... But again, as I said earlier, this 
    problem is unavoidable,  and totally out of
    intent.
      As my commitment to my responsibility for 
    problem  that we do not  want this happened
    but  it is already  late,  I  have  made my
    apology  gift   exclusively  for  whom  got
    affected. 
      Please take this gift as my apology, and
    thank you for spending  your time for read
    this apology letter. ^^)/
    
    Regards,
    Natsu Tadama.
